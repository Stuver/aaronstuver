    And I will bring glory to God today and for all eternity. </p>

  <p>I believe God created the Heavens and the Earth. I believe He designed Creation to be perfect, but humanity denied the perfection of God’s design—sinned—and was separated from Him.
God sent Jesus as a living sacrifice. He was betrayed, killed on a cross, and resurrected. His sacrifice served as a final sacrifice.<br><br>
Whoever believes in Him will not perish but is forgiven and will be reunited with God for eternity.
Because I have accepted this gift, I believe I will be taken with Christ when He returns again, and if I should die before that time, I believe I will be accepted into God’s kingdom and dwell with Him, bringing Him glory for eternity.<br><br>
This is my mission: to love and be in awe of God’s creation, the relationship/wisdom of the Holy Spirit, and my salvation through Jesus’ death and resurrection and to bring glory to God today and for all eternity. </p>
