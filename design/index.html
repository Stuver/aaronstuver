<title>Aaron's Design Path</title>
<body>
<h1 class="heading1">Purpose</h1>
<p>Through a career in Design, I will shape the narrative of how people interact with products to create an excellent experience for the user.</p>
<h2 class="heading2">Wishes for Career</h2>
<p>
1. Better others' lives through both my work and the community around my work.
<br>2. Provide for myself.
<br>3. Work in a community of encouraging, driven people.
</p>
<h1 class="heading1">Principles</h1>
<h2 class="heading2">Excellence in Design</h2>
<p>Usable; allows people to do more better, and reflects God's Creation, Character and Design.</p>
<h2 class="heading2">Usable</h1>
<p>I will lay aside my context, opening myself to understand the user's context, to create products that are tailored to their situation over my own.</p>
<h2 class="heading2">Anything you can do, you can do better</h2>
<p class="caption">Apple 2017 iPad Pro Campaign</p>
<p>I will create systems to increase user's efficiency with the goal of increasing their work/life balance and enhancing relationships outside the product.</p>
<h2 class="heading2">God's Design</h2>
<p>I believe that God's Design is perfect and the only Truth. I will go to the Bible and prayer for inspiration and guidance in understanding users - whom God created in His image; recognizing their need for the Gospel; and looking at systems in Creation and God's Plan for inspiration.</p>
<h2 class="heading2">Creativity</h2>
<p>Creativity is a gift from God. Good Design reflects Creation through invisibility and anonimity, benefiting the users so well, they do not even consciously recognize it.</p>
