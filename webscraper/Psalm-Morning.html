<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 22</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? <br/> 
          Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning? <br/><sup>2</sup>   O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer; <br/> 
          and by night, but find no rest.</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   Yet you are holy, <br/> 
          enthroned on the praises of Israel. <br/><sup>4</sup>   In you our ancestors trusted; <br/> 
          they trusted, and you delivered them. <br/><sup>5</sup>   To you they cried, and were saved; <br/> 
          in you they trusted, and were not put to shame.</p>
<br/><p><sup>6</sup>   But I am a worm, and not human; <br/> 
          scorned by others, and despised by the people. <br/><sup>7</sup>   All who see me mock at me; <br/> 
          they make mouths at me, they shake their heads; <br/><sup>8</sup>   “Commit your cause to the LORD; let him deliver — <br/>
          let him rescue the one in whom he delights!”</p>
<br/><p><sup>9</sup>   Yet it was you who took me from the womb; <br/> 
          you kept me safe on my mother’s breast. <br/><sup>10</sup>  On you I was cast from my birth, <br/> 
          and since my mother bore me you have been my God. <br/><sup>11</sup>  Do not be far from me, <br/> 
          for trouble is near <br/> 
          and there is no one to help.</p>
<br/><p><sup>12</sup>  Many bulls encircle me, <br/> 
          strong bulls of Bashan surround me; <br/><sup>13</sup>  they open wide their mouths at me, <br/> 
          like a ravening and roaring lion.</p>
<br/><p><sup>14</sup>  I am poured out like water, <br/> 
          and all my bones are out of joint; <br/> 
     my heart is like wax; <br/> 
          it is melted within my breast; <br/><sup>15</sup>  my mouth is dried up like a potsherd, <br/> 
          and my tongue sticks to my jaws; <br/> 
          you lay me in the dust of death. <br/><br/></p>
<p><sup>16</sup>  For dogs are all around me; <br/> 
          a company of evildoers encircles me. <br/> 
     My hands and feet have shriveled; <br/><sup>17</sup>  I can count all my bones. <br/> 
     They stare and gloat over me; <br/><sup>18</sup>  they divide my clothes among themselves, <br/> 
          and for my clothing they cast lots.</p>
<br/><p><sup>19</sup>  But you, O LORD, do not be far away! <br/> 
          O my help, come quickly to my aid! <br/><sup>20</sup>  Deliver my soul from the sword, <br/> 
          life from the power of the dog! <br/><sup>21</sup>       Save me from the mouth of the lion!</p>
<br/><p>     From the horns of the wild oxen you have rescued me. <br/><sup>22</sup>  I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters; <br/> 
          in the midst of the congregation I will praise you: <br/><sup>23</sup>  You who fear the LORD, praise him! <br/> 
          All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him; <br/> 
          stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel! <br/><sup>24</sup>  For he did not despise or abhor <br/> 
          the affliction of the afflicted; <br/> 
     he did not hide his face from me, <br/> 
          but heard when I cried to him.</p>
<br/><p><sup>25</sup>  From you comes my praise in the great congregation; <br/> 
          my vows I will pay before those who fear him. <br/><sup>26</sup>  The poor shall eat and be satisfied; <br/> 
          those who seek him shall praise the LORD. <br/> 
          May your hearts live forever!</p>
<br/><p><sup>27</sup>  All the ends of the earth shall remember <br/> 
          and turn to the LORD; <br/> 
     and all the families of the nations <br/> 
          shall worship before him. <br/><sup>28</sup>  For dominion belongs to the LORD, <br/> 
          and he rules over the nations.</p>
<br/><p><sup>29</sup>  To him, indeed, shall all who sleep in the earth bow down; <br/> 
          before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, <br/> 
          and I shall live for him. <br/><sup>30</sup>  Posterity will serve him; <br/> 
          future generations will be told about the Lord, <br/><sup>31</sup>  and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn, <br/> 
          saying that he has done it.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>   Praise the Lord! <br/> 
     Praise the Lord from the heavens; <br/> 
          praise him in the heights! <br/><sup>2</sup>   Praise him, all his angels; <br/> 
          praise him, all his host!</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   Praise him, sun and moon; <br/> 
          praise him, all you shining stars! <br/><sup>4</sup>   Praise him, you highest heavens, <br/> 
          and you waters above the heavens!</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Let them praise the name of the Lord, <br/> 
          for he commanded and they were created. <br/><sup>6</sup>   He established them forever and ever; <br/> 
          he fixed their bounds, which cannot be passed.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   Praise the Lord from the earth, <br/> 
          you sea monsters and all deeps, <br/><sup>8</sup>   fire and hail, snow and frost, <br/> 
          stormy wind fulfilling his command!</p>
<br/><p><sup>9</sup>   Mountains and all hills, <br/> 
          fruit trees and all cedars! <br/><sup>10</sup>  Wild animals and all cattle, <br/> 
          creeping things and flying birds!</p>
<br/><p><sup>11</sup>  Kings of the earth and all peoples, <br/> 
          princes and all rulers of the earth! <br/><sup>12</sup>  Young men and women alike, <br/> 
          old and young together!</p>
<br/><p><sup>13</sup>  Let them praise the name of the Lord, <br/> 
          for his name alone is exalted; <br/> 
          his glory is above earth and heaven. <br/><sup>14</sup>  He has raised up a horn for his people, <br/> 
          praise for all his faithful, <br/> 
          for the people of Israel who are close to him. <br/> 
     Praise the Lord!</p>
