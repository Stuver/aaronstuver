<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 99</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   The LORD is king; let the peoples tremble! <br/> 
          He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake! <br/><sup>2</sup>   The LORD is great in Zion; <br/> 
          he is exalted over all the peoples. <br/><sup>3</sup>   Let them praise your great and awesome name. <br/> 
          Holy is he! <br/><sup>4</sup>   Mighty King, lover of justice, <br/> 
          you have established equity; <br/> 
     you have executed justice <br/> 
          and righteousness in Jacob. <br/><sup>5</sup>   Extol the LORD our God; <br/> 
          worship at his footstool. <br/> 
          Holy is he! <br/><br/></p>
<p><sup>6</sup>   Moses and Aaron were among his priests, <br/> 
          Samuel also was among those who called on his name. <br/> 
          They cried to the LORD, and he answered them. <br/><sup>7</sup>   He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; <br/> 
          they kept his decrees, <br/> 
          and the statutes that he gave them.</p>
<br/><p><sup>8</sup>   O LORD our God, you answered them; <br/> 
          you were a forgiving God to them, <br/> 
          but an avenger of their wrongdoings. <br/><sup>9</sup>   Extol the LORD our God, <br/> 
          and worship at his holy mountain; <br/> 
          for the LORD our God is holy.</p>

<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 147:1-11</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Praise the Lord! <br/> 
          How good it is to sing praises to our God; <br/> 
          for he is gracious, and a song of praise is fitting. <br/><sup>2</sup>   The Lord builds up Jerusalem; <br/> 
          he gathers the outcasts of Israel. <br/><sup>3</sup>   He heals the brokenhearted, <br/> 
          and binds up their wounds. <br/><sup>4</sup>   He determines the number of the stars; <br/> 
          he gives to all of them their names. <br/><sup>5</sup>   Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; <br/> 
          his understanding is beyond measure. <br/><sup>6</sup>   The Lord lifts up the downtrodden; <br/> 
          he casts the wicked to the ground.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; <br/> 
          make melody to our God on the lyre. <br/><sup>8</sup>   He covers the heavens with clouds, <br/> 
          prepares rain for the earth, <br/> 
          makes grass grow on the hills. <br/><sup>9</sup>   He gives to the animals their food, <br/> 
          and to the young ravens when they cry. <br/><sup>10</sup>  His delight is not in the strength of the horse, <br/> 
          nor his pleasure in the speed of a runner; <br/><sup>11</sup>  but the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him, <br/> 
          in those who hope in his steadfast love.</p>
