<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 97</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   The LORD is king! Let the earth rejoice; <br/> 
          let the many coastlands be glad! <br/><sup>2</sup>   Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; <br/> 
          righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. <br/><sup>3</sup>   Fire goes before him, <br/> 
          and consumes his adversaries on every side. <br/><sup>4</sup>   His lightnings light up the world; <br/> 
          the earth sees and trembles. <br/><sup>5</sup>   The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, <br/> 
          before the Lord of all the earth.</p>
<br/><p><sup>6</sup>   The heavens proclaim his righteousness; <br/> 
          and all the peoples behold his glory. <br/><sup>7</sup>   All worshipers of images are put to shame, <br/> 
          those who make their boast in worthless idols; <br/> 
          all gods bow down before him. <br/><sup>8</sup>   Zion hears and is glad, <br/> 
          and the towns of Judah rejoice, <br/> 
          because of your judgments, O God. <br/><sup>9</sup>   For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth; <br/> 
          you are exalted far above all gods.</p>
<br/><p><sup>10</sup>  The LORD loves those who hate evil; <br/> 
          he guards the lives of his faithful; <br/> 
          he rescues them from the hand of the wicked. <br/><sup>11</sup>  Light dawns for the righteous, <br/> 
          and joy for the upright in heart. <br/><sup>12</sup>  Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, <br/> 
          and give thanks to his holy name!</p>

<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   I will extol you, my God and King, <br/> 
          and bless your name forever and ever. <br/><sup>2</sup>   Every day I will bless you, <br/> 
          and praise your name forever and ever. <br/><sup>3</sup>   Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; <br/> 
          his greatness is unsearchable.</p>
<br/><p><sup>4</sup>   One generation shall laud your works to another, <br/> 
          and shall declare your mighty acts. <br/><sup>5</sup>   On the glorious splendor of your majesty, <br/> 
          and on your wondrous works, I will meditate. <br/><sup>6</sup>   The might of your awesome deeds shall be proclaimed, <br/> 
          and I will declare your greatness. <br/><sup>7</sup>   They shall celebrate the fame of your abundant goodness, <br/> 
          and shall sing aloud of your righteousness.</p>
<br/><p><sup>8</sup>   The Lord is gracious and merciful, <br/> 
          slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. <br/><sup>9</sup>   The Lord is good to all, <br/> 
          and his compassion is over all that he has made.</p>
<br/><p><sup>10</sup>  All your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord, <br/> 
          and all your faithful shall bless you. <br/><sup>11</sup>  They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom, <br/> 
          and tell of your power, <br/><sup>12</sup>  to make known to all people your mighty deeds, <br/> 
          and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. <br/><sup>13</sup>  Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, <br/> 
          and your dominion endures throughout all generations.</p>
<br/><p>     The Lord is faithful in all his words, <br/> 
          and gracious in all his deeds. <br/><sup>14</sup>  The Lord upholds all who are falling, <br/> 
          and raises up all who are bowed down. <br/><sup>15</sup>  The eyes of all look to you, <br/> 
          and you give them their food in due season. <br/><sup>16</sup>  You open your hand, <br/> 
          satisfying the desire of every living thing. <br/><sup>17</sup>  The Lord is just in all his ways, <br/> 
          and kind in all his doings. <br/><sup>18</sup>  The Lord is near to all who call on him, <br/> 
          to all who call on him in truth. <br/><sup>19</sup>  He fulfills the desire of all who fear him; <br/> 
          he also hears their cry, and saves them. <br/><sup>20</sup>  The Lord watches over all who love him, <br/> 
          but all the wicked he will destroy.</p>
<br/><p><sup>21</sup>  My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord, <br/> 
          and all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever.</p>
