<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 92</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   It is good to give thanks to the LORD, <br/> 
          to sing praises to your name, O Most High; <br/><sup>2</sup>   to declare your steadfast love in the morning, <br/> 
          and your faithfulness by night, <br/><sup>3</sup>   to the music of the lute and the harp, <br/> 
          to the melody of the lyre. <br/><sup>4</sup>   For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; <br/> 
          at the works of your hands I sing for joy.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>   How great are your works, O LORD! <br/> 
          Your thoughts are very deep! <br/><sup>6</sup>   The dullard cannot know, <br/> 
          the stupid cannot understand this: <br/><sup>7</sup>   though the wicked sprout like grass <br/> 
          and all evildoers flourish, <br/> 
     they are doomed to destruction forever, <br/><sup>8</sup>        but you, O LORD, are on high forever. <br/><sup>9</sup>   For your enemies, O LORD, <br/> 
          for your enemies shall perish; <br/> 
          all evildoers shall be scattered.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>  But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; <br/> 
          you have poured over me fresh oil. <br/><sup>11</sup>  My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; <br/> 
          my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>  The righteous flourish like the palm tree, <br/> 
          and grow like a cedar in Lebanon. <br/><sup>13</sup>  They are planted in the house of the LORD; <br/> 
          they flourish in the courts of our God. <br/><sup>14</sup>  In old age they still produce fruit; <br/> 
          they are always green and full of sap, <br/><sup>15</sup>  showing that the LORD is upright; <br/> 
          he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>

<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 149</p>
<div><p><sup>1</sup>   Praise the Lord! <br/> 
     Sing to the Lord a new song, <br/> 
          his praise in the assembly of the faithful. <br/><sup>2</sup>   Let Israel be glad in its Maker; <br/> 
          let the children of Zion rejoice in their King. <br/><sup>3</sup>   Let them praise his name with dancing, <br/> 
          making melody to him with tambourine and lyre. <br/><sup>4</sup>   For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; <br/> 
          he adorns the humble with victory. <br/><sup>5</sup>   Let the faithful exult in glory; <br/> 
          let them sing for joy on their couches. <br/><sup>6</sup>   Let the high praises of God be in their throats <br/> 
          and two-edged swords in their hands, <br/><sup>7</sup>   to execute vengeance on the nations <br/> 
          and punishment on the peoples, <br/><sup>8</sup>   to bind their kings with fetters <br/> 
          and their nobles with chains of iron, <br/><sup>9</sup>   to execute on them the judgment decreed. <br/> 
          This is glory for all his faithful ones. <br/> 
     Praise the Lord!</p></div>
