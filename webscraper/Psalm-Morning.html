<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 96</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   O sing to the LORD a new song; <br/> 
          sing to the LORD, all the earth. <br/><sup>2</sup>   Sing to the LORD, bless his name; <br/> 
          tell of his salvation from day to day. <br/><sup>3</sup>   Declare his glory among the nations, <br/> 
          his marvelous works among all the peoples. <br/><sup>4</sup>   For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; <br/> 
          he is to be revered above all gods. <br/><sup>5</sup>   For all the gods of the peoples are idols, <br/> 
          but the LORD made the heavens. <br/><sup>6</sup>   Honor and majesty are before him; <br/> 
          strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. <br/><sup>7</sup>   Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, <br/> 
          ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. <br/><sup>8</sup>   Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; <br/> 
          bring an offering, and come into his courts. <br/><sup>9</sup>   Worship the LORD in holy splendor; <br/> 
          tremble before him, all the earth.</p>
<br/><p><sup>10</sup>  Say among the nations, “The LORD is king! <br/> 
          The world is firmly established; it shall never be moved. <br/> 
          He will judge the peoples with equity.” <br/><sup>11</sup>  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; <br/> 
          let the sea roar, and all that fills it; <br/><sup>12</sup>       let the field exult, and everything in it. <br/> 
     Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy <br/><sup>13</sup>       before the LORD; for he is coming, <br/> 
          for he is coming to judge the earth. <br/> 
     He will judge the world with righteousness, <br/> 
          and the peoples with his truth.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>   Praise the Lord! <br/> 
     Praise the Lord from the heavens; <br/> 
          praise him in the heights! <br/><sup>2</sup>   Praise him, all his angels; <br/> 
          praise him, all his host!</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   Praise him, sun and moon; <br/> 
          praise him, all you shining stars! <br/><sup>4</sup>   Praise him, you highest heavens, <br/> 
          and you waters above the heavens!</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Let them praise the name of the Lord, <br/> 
          for he commanded and they were created. <br/><sup>6</sup>   He established them forever and ever; <br/> 
          he fixed their bounds, which cannot be passed.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   Praise the Lord from the earth, <br/> 
          you sea monsters and all deeps, <br/><sup>8</sup>   fire and hail, snow and frost, <br/> 
          stormy wind fulfilling his command!</p>
<br/><p><sup>9</sup>   Mountains and all hills, <br/> 
          fruit trees and all cedars! <br/><sup>10</sup>  Wild animals and all cattle, <br/> 
          creeping things and flying birds!</p>
<br/><p><sup>11</sup>  Kings of the earth and all peoples, <br/> 
          princes and all rulers of the earth! <br/><sup>12</sup>  Young men and women alike, <br/> 
          old and young together!</p>
<br/><p><sup>13</sup>  Let them praise the name of the Lord, <br/> 
          for his name alone is exalted; <br/> 
          his glory is above earth and heaven. <br/><sup>14</sup>  He has raised up a horn for his people, <br/> 
          praise for all his faithful, <br/> 
          for the people of Israel who are close to him. <br/> 
     Praise the Lord!</p>
