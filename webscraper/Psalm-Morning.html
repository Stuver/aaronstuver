<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   The LORD is king, he is robed in majesty; <br/> 
          the LORD is robed, he is girded with strength. <br/> 
     He has established the world; it shall never be moved; <br/><sup>2</sup>        your throne is established from of old; <br/> 
          you are from everlasting.</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   The floods have lifted up, O LORD, <br/> 
          the floods have lifted up their voice; <br/> 
          the floods lift up their roaring. <br/><sup>4</sup>   More majestic than the thunders of mighty waters, <br/> 
          more majestic than the waves of the sea, <br/> 
          majestic on high is the LORD!</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Your decrees are very sure; <br/> 
          holiness befits your house, <br/> 
          O LORD, forevermore.</p>
