<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 98</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   O sing to the LORD a new song, <br/> 
          for he has done marvelous things. <br/> 
     His right hand and his holy arm <br/> 
          have gained him victory. <br/><sup>2</sup>   The LORD has made known his victory; <br/> 
          he has revealed his vindication in the sight of the nations. <br/><sup>3</sup>   He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness <br/> 
          to the house of Israel. <br/> 
     All the ends of the earth have seen <br/> 
          the victory of our God.</p>
<br/><p><sup>4</sup>   Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; <br/> 
          break forth into joyous song and sing praises. <br/><sup>5</sup>   Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, <br/> 
          with the lyre and the sound of melody. <br/><sup>6</sup>   With trumpets and the sound of the horn <br/> 
          make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; <br/> 
          the world and those who live in it. <br/><sup>8</sup>   Let the floods clap their hands; <br/> 
          let the hills sing together for joy <br/><sup>9</sup>   at the presence of the LORD, for he is coming <br/> 
          to judge the earth. <br/> 
     He will judge the world with righteousness, <br/> 
          and the peoples with equity.</p>

<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 146</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Praise the LORD! <br/> 
     Praise the LORD, O my soul! <br/><sup>2</sup>   I will praise the LORD as long as I live; <br/> 
          I will sing praises to my God all my life long.</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   Do not put your trust in princes, <br/> 
          in mortals, in whom there is no help. <br/><sup>4</sup>   When their breath departs, they return to the earth; <br/> 
          on that very day their plans perish.</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Happy are those whose help is the God of Jacob, <br/> 
          whose hope is in the LORD their God, <br/><sup>6</sup>   who made heaven and earth, <br/> 
          the sea, and all that is in them; <br/> 
     who keeps faith forever; <br/><sup>7</sup>        who executes justice for the oppressed; <br/> 
          who gives food to the hungry.</p>
<br/><p>     The LORD sets the prisoners free; <br/><sup>8</sup>        the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. <br/> 
     The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; <br/> 
          the LORD loves the righteous. <br/><sup>9</sup>   The LORD watches over the strangers; <br/> 
          he upholds the orphan and the widow, <br/> 
          but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.</p>
<br/><p><sup>10</sup>  The LORD will reign forever, <br/> 
          your God, O Zion, for all generations. <br/> 
     Praise the LORD!</p>
