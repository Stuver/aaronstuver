<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 47</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Clap your hands, all you peoples; <br/> 
          shout to God with loud songs of joy. <br/><sup>2</sup>   For the LORD, the Most High, is awesome, <br/> 
          a great king over all the earth. <br/><sup>3</sup>   He subdued peoples under us, <br/> 
          and nations under our feet. <br/><sup>4</sup>   He chose our heritage for us, <br/> 
          the pride of Jacob whom he loves. <em>Selah</em></p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   God has gone up with a shout, <br/> 
          the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. <br/><sup>6</sup>   Sing praises to God, sing praises; <br/> 
          sing praises to our King, sing praises. <br/><sup>7</sup>   For God is the king of all the earth; <br/> 
          sing praises with a psalm.</p>
<br/><p><sup>8</sup>   God is king over the nations; <br/> 
          God sits on his holy throne. <br/><sup>9</sup>   The princes of the peoples gather <br/> 
          as the people of the God of Abraham. <br/> 
     For the shields of the earth belong to God; <br/> 
          he is highly exalted.</p>

<p class="kappa">Morning Psalm 147:12-20</p>
<div><p><sup>12</sup>  Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem! <br/> 
          Praise your God, O Zion! <br/><sup>13</sup>  For he strengthens the bars of your gates; <br/> 
          he blesses your children within you. <br/><sup>14</sup>  He grants peace within your borders; <br/> 
          he fills you with the finest of wheat. <br/><sup>15</sup>  He sends out his command to the earth; <br/> 
          his word runs swiftly. <br/><sup>16</sup>  He gives snow like wool; <br/> 
          he scatters frost like ashes. <br/><sup>17</sup>  He hurls down hail like crumbs — <br/> 
          who can stand before his cold? <br/><sup>18</sup>  He sends out his word, and melts them; <br/> 
          he makes his wind blow, and the waters flow. <br/><sup>19</sup>  He declares his word to Jacob, <br/> 
          his statutes and ordinances to Israel. <br/><sup>20</sup>  He has not dealt thus with any other nation; <br/> 
          they do not know his ordinances. <br/> 
     Praise the Lord!</p></div>
