<p class="indent"><sup>17</sup>When Pharaoh let the
          people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of
          the Philistines, although that was nearer; for God
          thought, "If the people face war, they may change
          their minds and return to Egypt." <sup>18</sup>So God led the people by the
          roundabout way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. The
          Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt prepared for
          battle. <sup>19</sup>And Moses
          took with him the bones of Joseph who had required a
          solemn oath of the Israelites, saying, "God will
          surely take notice of you, and then you must carry my
          bones with you from here." <sup>20</sup>They set out from Succoth, and
          camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
          <sup>21</sup>The LORD went in
          front of them in a pillar of cloud by day, to lead them
          along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give
          them light, so that they might travel by day and by
          night. <sup>22</sup>Neither the
          pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night
          left its place in front of the people.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>Then the LORD said to
          Moses: <sup>2</sup>Tell the
          Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth,
          between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you
          shall camp opposite it, by the sea. <sup>3</sup>Pharaoh will say of the
          Israelites, "They are wandering aimlessly in the
          land; the wilderness has closed in on them."
          <sup>4</sup>I will harden
          Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them, so that I
          will gain glory for myself over Pharaoh and all his army;
          and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD. And they
          did so.
