<p class="kappa">First Reading Lamentations 3:1-9, 19-33</p>
<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>I am one who has seen
          affliction under the rod of God's wrath; <sup>2</sup>he has driven and brought me into
          darkness without any light; <sup>3</sup>against me alone he turns his
          hand, again and again, all day long.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>4</sup>He has made my flesh
          and my skin waste away, and broken my bones; <sup>5</sup>he has besieged and enveloped me
          with bitterness and tribulation; <sup>6</sup>he has made me sit in darkness
          like the dead of long ago.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>7</sup>He has walled me about
          so that I cannot escape; he has put heavy chains on me;
          <sup>8</sup>though I call and cry
          for help, he shuts out my prayer; <sup>9</sup>he has blocked my ways with hewn
          stones, he has made my paths crooked.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>19</sup>The thought of my
          affliction and my homelessness is wormwood and gall!
          <sup>20</sup>My soul continually
          thinks of it and is bowed down within me. <sup>21</sup>But this I call to mind, and
          therefore I have hope: <sup>22</sup>The steadfast love of the LORD
          never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;
          <sup>23</sup>they are new every
          morning; great is your faithfulness. <sup>24</sup>"The LORD is my
          portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope
          in him."
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>25</sup>The LORD is good to
          those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
          <sup>26</sup>It is good that one
          should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
          <sup>27</sup>It is good for one to
          bear the yoke in youth, <sup>28</sup>to sit alone in silence when the
          Lord has imposed it, <sup>29</sup>to put one's mouth to the
          dust (there may yet be hope), <sup>30</sup>to give one's cheek to the
          smiter, and be filled with insults.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>31</sup>For the Lord will not
          reject forever. <sup>32</sup>Although he causes grief, he will
          have compassion according to the abundance of his
          steadfast love; <sup>33</sup>for
          he does not willingly afflict or grieve anyone.
