<p class="kappa">First Reading Exodus 15:1-21</p>
<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>Then Moses and the
          Israelites sang this song to the LORD: "I will sing
          to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; horse and
          rider he has thrown into the sea. <sup>2</sup>The LORD is my strength and my
          might, and he has become my salvation; this is my God,
          and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will
          exalt him. <sup>3</sup>The LORD is
          a warrior; the LORD is his name.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>4</sup>"Pharaoh's
          chariots and his army he cast into the sea; his picked
          officers were sunk in the Red Sea. <sup>5</sup>The floods covered them; they went
          down into the depths like a stone. <sup>6</sup>Your right hand, O LORD, glorious
          in power - your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy.
          <sup>7</sup>In the greatness of
          your majesty you overthrew your adversaries; you sent out
          your fury, it consumed them like stubble. <sup>8</sup>At the blast of your nostrils the
          waters piled up, the floods stood up in a heap; the deeps
          congealed in the heart of the sea. <sup>9</sup>The enemy said, 'I will
          pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my
          desire shall have its fill of them. I will draw my sword,
          my hand shall destroy them.' <sup>10</sup>You blew with your wind, the sea
          covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>11</sup>"Who is like
          you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in
          holiness, awesome in splendor, doing wonders?
          <sup>12</sup>You stretched out
          your right hand, the earth swallowed them.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>13</sup>"In your
          steadfast love you led the people whom you redeemed; you
          guided them by your strength to your holy abode.
          <sup>14</sup>The peoples heard,
          they trembled; pangs seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
          <sup>15</sup>Then the chiefs of
          Edom were dismayed; trembling seized the leaders of Moab;
          all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away. <sup>16</sup>Terror and dread fell upon them;
          by the might of your arm, they became still as a stone
          until your people, O LORD, passed by, until the people
          whom you acquired passed by. <sup>17</sup>You brought them in and planted
          them on the mountain of your own possession, the place, O
          LORD, that you made your abode, the sanctuary, O LORD,
          that your hands have established. <sup>18</sup>The LORD will reign forever and
          ever."
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>19</sup>When the horses of
          Pharaoh with his chariots and his chariot drivers went
          into the sea, the LORD brought back the waters of the sea
          upon them; but the Israelites walked through the sea on
          dry ground.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>20</sup>Then the prophet
          Miriam, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her
          hand; and all the women went out after her with
          tambourines and with dancing. <sup>21</sup>And Miriam sang to them:
          "Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously;
          horse and rider he has thrown into the sea."
