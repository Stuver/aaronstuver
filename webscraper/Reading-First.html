<div><p class="indent"><sup>3</sup>Moses said to the
          people, "Remember this day on which you came out of
          Egypt, out of the house of slavery, because the LORD
          brought you out from there by strength of hand; no
          leavened bread shall be eaten. <sup>4</sup>Today, in the month of Abib, you
          are going out. <sup>5</sup>When
          the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the
          Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
          which he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land
          flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this
          observance in this month. <sup>6</sup>Seven days you shall eat
          unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a
          festival to the LORD. <sup>7</sup>Unleavened bread shall be eaten
          for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen in your
          possession, and no leaven shall be seen among you in all
          your territory. <sup>8</sup>You
          shall tell your child on that day, 'It is because of
          what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
          <sup>9</sup>It shall serve for you
          as a sign on your hand and as a reminder on your
          forehead, so that the teaching of the LORD may be on your
          lips; for with a strong hand the LORD brought you out of
          Egypt. <sup>10</sup>You shall keep
          this ordinance at its proper time from year to
          year."
