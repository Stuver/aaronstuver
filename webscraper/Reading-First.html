<p class="indent"><sup>14</sup>This day shall be a
          day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a
          festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you
          shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance. <sup>15</sup>Seven days you shall eat
          unleavened bread; on the first day you shall remove
          leaven from your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread
          from the first day until the seventh day shall be cut off
          from Israel. <sup>16</sup>On the
          first day you shall hold a solemn assembly, and on the
          seventh day a solemn assembly; no work shall be done on
          those days; only what everyone must eat, that alone may
          be prepared by you. <sup>17</sup>You shall observe the festival of
          unleavened bread, for on this very day I brought your
          companies out of the land of Egypt: you shall observe
          this day throughout your generations as a perpetual
          ordinance. <sup>18</sup>In the
          first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until
          the evening of the twenty-first day, you shall eat
          unleavened bread. <sup>19</sup>For
          seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for
          whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off from the
          congregation of Israel, whether an alien or a native of
          the land. <sup>20</sup>You shall
          eat nothing leavened; in all your settlements you shall
          eat unleavened bread.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>21</sup>Then Moses called all
          the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go, select
          lambs for your families, and slaughter the passover lamb.
          <sup>22</sup>Take a bunch of
          hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and
          touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood in
          the basin. None of you shall go outside the door of your
          house until morning. <sup>23</sup>For the LORD will pass through to
          strike down the Egyptians; when he sees the blood on the
          lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over
          that door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your
          houses to strike you down. <sup>24</sup>You shall observe this rite as a
          perpetual ordinance for you and your children.
          <sup>25</sup>When you come to the
          land that the LORD will give you, as he has promised, you
          shall keep this observance. <sup>26</sup>And when your children ask you,
          'What do you mean by this observance?'
          <sup>27</sup>you shall say,
          'It is the passover sacrifice to the LORD, for he
          passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when
          he struck down the Egyptians but spared our
          houses.'" And the people bowed down and
          worshiped.
