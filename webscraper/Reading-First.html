<p class="indent"><sup>40</sup>The time that the
          Israelites had lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty
          years. <sup>41</sup>At the end of
          four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the
          companies of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
          <sup>42</sup>That was for the LORD
          a night of vigil, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
          That same night is a vigil to be kept for the LORD by all
          the Israelites throughout their generations.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>43</sup>The LORD said to
          Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance for the passover:
          no foreigner shall eat of it, <sup>44</sup>but any slave who has been
          purchased may eat of it after he has been circumcised;
          <sup>45</sup>no bound or hired
          servant may eat of it. <sup>46</sup>It shall be eaten in one house;
          you shall not take any of the animal outside the house,
          and you shall not break any of its bones. <sup>47</sup>The whole congregation of Israel
          shall celebrate it. <sup>48</sup>If an alien who resides with you
          wants to celebrate the passover to the LORD, all his
          males shall be circumcised; then he may draw near to
          celebrate it; he shall be regarded as a native of the
          land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it;
          <sup>49</sup>there shall be one
          law for the native and for the alien who resides among
          you.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>50</sup>All the Israelites
          did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
          <sup>51</sup>That very day the
          LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt,
          company by company.
