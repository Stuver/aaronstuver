<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>The LORD said to
          Moses: <sup>2</sup>Consecrate to
          me all the firstborn; whatever is the first to open the
          womb among the Israelites, of human beings and animals,
          is mine.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>11</sup>"When the LORD
          has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, as he
          swore to you and your ancestors, and has given it to you,
          <sup>12</sup>you shall set apart
          to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the
          firstborn of your livestock that are males shall be the
          Lord's. <sup>13</sup>But every
          firstborn donkey you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do
          not redeem it, you must break its neck. Every firstborn
          male among your children you shall redeem. <sup>14</sup>When in the future your child
          asks you, 'What does this mean?' you shall
          answer, 'By strength of hand the LORD brought us out
          of Egypt, from the house of slavery. <sup>15</sup>When Pharaoh stubbornly refused
          to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the
          land of Egypt, from human firstborn to the firstborn of
          animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD every male
          that first opens the womb, but every firstborn of my sons
          I redeem.' <sup>16</sup>It
          shall serve as a sign on your hand and as an emblem on
          your forehead that by strength of hand the LORD brought
          us out of Egypt."
