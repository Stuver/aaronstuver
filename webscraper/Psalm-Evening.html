          for his steadfast love endures forever;</p>
<br/><p><sup>4</sup>   who alone does great wonders, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>5</sup>   who by understanding made the heavens, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>6</sup>   who spread out the earth on the waters, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>7</sup>   who made the great lights, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>8</sup>   the sun to rule over the day, <br/>

<br/><p><sup>10</sup>  who struck Egypt through their firstborn, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>11</sup>  and brought Israel out from among them, <br/>

          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>13</sup>  who divided the Red Sea in two, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>14</sup>  and made Israel pass through the midst of it, <br/>

          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>16</sup>  who led his people through the wilderness, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>17</sup>  who struck down great kings, <br/>

          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>19</sup>  Sihon, king of the Amorites, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>20</sup>  and Og, king of Bashan, <br/>

          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>22</sup>  a heritage to his servant Israel, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever.</p>
<br/><p><sup>23</sup>  It is he who remembered us in our low estate, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>24</sup>  and rescued us from our foes, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever; <br/><sup>25</sup>  who gives food to all flesh, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever.</p>
<br/><p><sup>26</sup>  O give thanks to the God of heaven, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever.</p>
