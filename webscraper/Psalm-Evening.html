<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, <br/> 
          make known his deeds among the peoples. <br/><sup>2</sup>   Sing to him, sing praises to him; <br/> 
          tell of all his wonderful works. <br/><sup>3</sup>   Glory in his holy name; <br/> 
          let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. <br/><sup>4</sup>   Seek the LORD and his strength; <br/> 
          seek his presence continually. <br/><sup>5</sup>   Remember the wonderful works he has done, <br/> 
          his miracles, and the judgments he has uttered, <br/><sup>6</sup>   O offspring of his servant Abraham, <br/> 
          children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   He is the LORD our God; <br/> 
          his judgments are in all the earth. <br/><sup>8</sup>   He is mindful of his covenant forever, <br/> 
          of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, <br/><sup>9</sup>   the covenant that he made with Abraham, <br/> 
          his sworn promise to Isaac, <br/><sup>10</sup>  which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, <br/> 
          to Israel as an everlasting covenant, <br/><sup>11</sup>  saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan <br/> 
          as your portion for an inheritance.”</p>
<br/><p><sup>12</sup>  When they were few in number, <br/> 
          of little account, and strangers in it, <br/><sup>13</sup>  wandering from nation to nation, <br/> 
          from one kingdom to another people, <br/><sup>14</sup>  he allowed no one to oppress them; <br/> 
          he rebuked kings on their account, <br/><sup>15</sup>  saying, “Do not touch my anointed ones; <br/> 
          do my prophets no harm.” <br/><br/></p>
<p><sup>16</sup>  When he summoned famine against the land, <br/> 
          and broke every staff of bread, <br/><sup>17</sup>  he had sent a man ahead of them, <br/> 
          Joseph, who was sold as a slave. <br/><sup>18</sup>  His feet were hurt with fetters, <br/> 
          his neck was put in a collar of iron; <br/><sup>19</sup>  until what he had said came to pass, <br/> 
          the word of the LORD kept testing him. <br/><sup>20</sup>  The king sent and released him; <br/> 
          the ruler of the peoples set him free. <br/><sup>21</sup>  He made him lord of his house, <br/> 
          and ruler of all his possessions, <br/><sup>22</sup>  to instruct his officials at his pleasure, <br/> 
          and to teach his elders wisdom.</p>
<br/><p><sup>23</sup>  Then Israel came to Egypt; <br/> 
          Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham. <br/><sup>24</sup>  And the LORD made his people very fruitful, <br/> 
          and made them stronger than their foes, <br/><sup>25</sup>  whose hearts he then turned to hate his people, <br/> 
          to deal craftily with his servants.</p>
<br/><p><sup>26</sup>  He sent his servant Moses, <br/> 
          and Aaron whom he had chosen. <br/><sup>27</sup>  They performed his signs among them, <br/> 
          and miracles in the land of Ham. <br/><sup>28</sup>  He sent darkness, and made the land dark; <br/> 
          they rebelled against his words. <br/></p>
<p><sup>29</sup>  He turned their waters into blood, <br/> 
          and caused their fish to die. <br/><sup>30</sup>  Their land swarmed with frogs, <br/> 
          even in the chambers of their kings. <br/><sup>31</sup>  He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, <br/> 
          and gnats throughout their country. <br/><sup>32</sup>  He gave them hail for rain, <br/> 
          and lightning that flashed through their land. <br/><sup>33</sup>  He struck their vines and fig trees, <br/> 
          and shattered the trees of their country. <br/><sup>34</sup>  He spoke, and the locusts came, <br/> 
          and young locusts without number; <br/><sup>35</sup>  they devoured all the vegetation in their land, <br/> 
          and ate up the fruit of their ground. <br/><sup>36</sup>  He struck down all the firstborn in their land, <br/> 
          the first issue of all their strength.</p>
<br/><p><sup>37</sup>  Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold, <br/> 
          and there was no one among their tribes who stumbled. <br/><sup>38</sup>  Egypt was glad when they departed, <br/> 
          for dread of them had fallen upon it. <br/><sup>39</sup>  He spread a cloud for a covering, <br/> 
          and fire to give light by night. <br/></p>
<p><sup>40</sup>  They asked, and he brought quails, <br/> 
          and gave them food from heaven in abundance. <br/><sup>41</sup>  He opened the rock, and water gushed out; <br/> 
          it flowed through the desert like a river. <br/><sup>42</sup>  For he remembered his holy promise, <br/> 
          and Abraham, his servant.</p>
<br/><p><sup>43</sup>  So he brought his people out with joy, <br/> 
          his chosen ones with singing. <br/><sup>44</sup>  He gave them the lands of the nations, <br/> 
          and they took possession of the wealth of the peoples, <br/><sup>45</sup>  that they might keep his statutes <br/> 
          and observe his laws. <br/> 
     Praise the LORD!</p>

<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD. <br/><sup>2</sup>       Lord, hear my voice! <br/> 
     Let your ears be attentive <br/> 
          to the voice of my supplications!</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities, <br/> 
          Lord, who could stand? <br/><sup>4</sup>   But there is forgiveness with you, <br/> 
          so that you may be revered.</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, <br/> 
          and in his word I hope; <br/><sup>6</sup>   my soul waits for the Lord <br/> 
          more than those who watch for the morning, <br/> 
          more than those who watch for the morning.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   O Israel, hope in the LORD! <br/> 
          For with the LORD there is steadfast love, <br/> 
          and with him is great power to redeem. <br/><sup>8</sup>   It is he who will redeem Israel <br/> 
          from all its iniquities.</p>
