<p class="kappa">Evening Psalm 49</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Hear this, all you peoples; <br/> 
          give ear, all inhabitants of the world, <br/><sup>2</sup>   both low and high, <br/> 
          rich and poor together. <br/><sup>3</sup>   My mouth shall speak wisdom; <br/> 
          the meditation of my heart shall be understanding. <br/><sup>4</sup>   I will incline my ear to a proverb; <br/> 
          I will solve my riddle to the music of the harp.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>   Why should I fear in times of trouble, <br/> 
          when the iniquity of my persecutors surrounds me, <br/><sup>6</sup>   those who trust in their wealth <br/> 
          and boast of the abundance of their riches? <br/><sup>7</sup>   Truly, no ransom avails for one’s life, <br/> 
          there is no price one can give to God for it. <br/><sup>8</sup>   For the ransom of life is costly, <br/> 
          and can never suffice, <br/><sup>9</sup>   that one should live on forever <br/> 
          and never see the grave.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>   When we look at the wise, they die; <br/> 
          fool and dolt perish together <br/> 
          and leave their wealth to others. <br/><sup>11</sup>   Their graves are their homes forever, <br/> 
          their dwelling places to all generations, <br/> 
          though they named lands their own. <br/><sup>12</sup>  Mortals cannot abide in their pomp; <br/> 
          they are like the animals that perish.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>  Such is the fate of the foolhardy, <br/> 
          the end of those who are pleased with their lot. <em>Selah</em> <br/><sup>14</sup>  Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; <br/> 
          Death shall be their shepherd; <br/> 
     straight to the grave they descend, <br/> 
          and their form shall waste away; <br/> 
          Sheol shall be their home. <br/><sup>15</sup>  But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, <br/> 
          for he will receive me. <em>Selah</em></p>
<p><sup>16</sup>  Do not be afraid when some become rich, <br/> 
          when the wealth of their houses increases. <br/><sup>17</sup>  For when they die they will carry nothing away; <br/> 
          their wealth will not go down after them. <br/><sup>18</sup>  Though in their lifetime they count themselves happy <br/> 
          — for you are praised when you do well for yourself — <br/><sup>19</sup>  they will go to the company of their ancestors, <br/> 
          who will never again see the light. <br/><sup>20</sup>  Mortals cannot abide in their pomp; <br/> 
          they are like the animals that perish.</p>

<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   I give you thanks, O LORD, with my whole heart; <br/> 
          before the gods I sing your praise; <br/><sup>2</sup>   I bow down toward your holy temple <br/> 
          and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness; <br/> 
          for you have exalted your name and your word <br/> 
          above everything. <br/><sup>3</sup>   On the day I called, you answered me, <br/> 
          you increased my strength of soul.</p>
<br/><p><sup>4</sup>   All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD, <br/> 
          for they have heard the words of your mouth. <br/><sup>5</sup>   They shall sing of the ways of the LORD, <br/> 
          for great is the glory of the LORD. <br/><sup>6</sup>   For though the LORD is high, he regards the lowly; <br/> 
          but the haughty he perceives from far away.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   Though I walk in the midst of trouble, <br/> 
          you preserve me against the wrath of my enemies; <br/> 
     you stretch out your hand, <br/> 
          and your right hand delivers me. <br/><sup>8</sup>   The LORD will fulfill his purpose for me; <br/> 
          your steadfast love, O LORD, endures forever. <br/> 
          Do not forsake the work of your hands.</p>
