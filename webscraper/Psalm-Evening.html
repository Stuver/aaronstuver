<p class="kappa">Evening Psalm 68</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Let God rise up, let his enemies be scattered; <br/> 
          let those who hate him flee before him. <br/><sup>2</sup>   As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; <br/> 
          as wax melts before the fire, <br/> 
          let the wicked perish before God. <br/><sup>3</sup>   But let the righteous be joyful; <br/> 
          let them exult before God; <br/> 
          let them be jubilant with joy.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>   Sing to God, sing praises to his name; <br/> 
          lift up a song to him who rides upon the clouds — <br/> 
     his name is the LORD — <br/>
          be exultant before him.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>   Father of orphans and protector of widows <br/> 
          is God in his holy habitation. <br/><sup>6</sup>   God gives the desolate a home to live in; <br/> 
          he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, <br/> 
          but the rebellious live in a parched land.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>   O God, when you went out before your people, <br/> 
          when you marched through the wilderness, <em>Selah</em> <br/><sup>8</sup>   the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain <br/> 
          at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, <br/> 
          at the presence of God, the God of Israel. <br/><sup>9</sup>   Rain in abundance, O God, you showered abroad; <br/> 
          you restored your heritage when it languished; <br/><sup>10</sup>  your flock found a dwelling in it; <br/> 
          in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>  The Lord gives the command; <br/> 
          great is the company of those who bore the tidings <br/><sup>12</sup>       “The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!” <br/> 
     The women at home divide the spoil, <br/><sup>13</sup>       though they stay among the sheepfolds — <br/> 
     the wings of a dove covered with silver, <br/> 
          its pinions with green gold. <br/><sup>14</sup>  When the Almighty scattered kings there, <br/> 
          snow fell on Zalmon.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>  O mighty mountain, mountain of Bashan; <br/> 
          O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan! <br/><sup>16</sup>  Why do you look with envy, O many-peaked mountain, <br/> 
          at the mount that God desired for his abode, <br/> 
          where the LORD will reside for ever?</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>  With mighty chariotry, twice ten thousand, <br/> 
          thousands upon thousands, <br/> 
          the Lord came from Sinai into the holy place. <br/><sup>18</sup>  You ascended the high mount, <br/> 
          leading captives in your train <br/> 
          and receiving gifts from people, <br/> 
     even from those who rebel against the LORD God’s abiding there. <br/><sup>19</sup>  Blessed be the Lord, <br/> 
          who daily bears us up; <br/> 
          God is our salvation. <em>Selah</em> <br/><sup>20</sup>  Our God is a God of salvation, <br/> 
          and to GOD, the Lord, belongs escape from death.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>  But God will shatter the heads of his enemies, <br/> 
          the hairy crown of those  who walk in their guilty ways. <br/><sup>22</sup>  The Lord said, <br/> 
          “I will bring them back from Bashan, <br/> 
     I will bring them back from the depths of the sea, <br/><sup>23</sup>  so that you may bathe your feet in blood, <br/> 
          so that the tongues of your dogs may have their share from the foe.”</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>  Your solemn processions are seen, O God, <br/> 
          the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary — <br/><sup>25</sup>  the singers in front, the musicians last, <br/> 
          between them girls playing tambourines: <br/></p>
<p><sup>26</sup>  “Bless God in the great congregation, <br/> 
          the LORD, O you who are of Israel’s fountain!” <br/><sup>27</sup>  There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, <br/> 
          the princes of Judah in a body, <br/> 
          the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>  Summon your might, O God; <br/> 
          show your strength, O God, as you have done for us before. <br/><sup>29</sup>  Because of your temple at Jerusalem <br/> 
          kings bear gifts to you. <br/><sup>30</sup>  Rebuke the wild animals that live among the reeds, <br/> 
          the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. <br/> 
     Trample under foot those who lust after tribute; <br/> 
          scatter the peoples who delight in war. <br/><sup>31</sup>  Let bronze be brought from Egypt; <br/> 
          let Ethiopia hasten to stretch out its hands to God.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>  Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; <br/> 
          sing praises to the Lord, <em>Selah</em> <br/><sup>33</sup>  O rider in the heavens, the ancient heavens; <br/> 
          listen, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice. <br/><sup>34</sup>  Ascribe power to God, <br/> 
          whose majesty is over Israel; <br/> 
          and whose power is in the skies. <br/><sup>35</sup>  Awesome is God in his sanctuary, <br/> 
          the God of Israel; <br/> 
          he gives power and strength to his people.</p>
<p>     Blessed be God!</p>

<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Praise the LORD! <br/> 
     Praise, O servants of the LORD; <br/> 
          praise the name of the LORD.</p>
<br/><p><sup>2</sup>   Blessed be the name of the LORD <br/> 
          from this time on and forevermore. <br/><sup>3</sup>   From the rising of the sun to its setting <br/> 
          the name of the LORD is to be praised. <br/><sup>4</sup>   The LORD is high above all nations, <br/> 
          and his glory above the heavens.</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Who is like the LORD our God, <br/> 
          who is seated on high, <br/><sup>6</sup>   who looks far down <br/> 
          on the heavens and the earth? <br/></p>
<p><sup>7</sup>   He raises the poor from the dust, <br/> 
          and lifts the needy from the ash heap, <br/><sup>8</sup>   to make them sit with princes, <br/> 
          with the princes of his people. <br/><sup>9</sup>   He gives the barren woman a home, <br/> 
          making her the joyous mother of children. <br/> 
     Praise the LORD!</p>
