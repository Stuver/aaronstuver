<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   If it had not been the LORD who was on our side <br/>  
          — let Israel now say — <br/><sup>2</sup>   if it had not been the LORD who was on our side, <br/> 
          when our enemies attacked us, <br/><sup>3</sup>   then they would have swallowed us up alive, <br/> 
          when their anger was kindled against us; <br/><sup>4</sup>   then the flood would have swept us away, <br/> 
          the torrent would have gone over us; <br/><sup>5</sup>   then over us would have gone <br/> 
          the raging waters.</p>
<br/><p><sup>6</sup>   Blessed be the LORD, <br/> 
          who has not given us <br/> 
          as prey to their teeth. <br/><sup>7</sup>   We have escaped like a bird <br/> 
          from the snare of the fowlers; <br/> 
     the snare is broken, <br/> 
          and we have escaped.</p>
<br/><p><sup>8</sup>   Our help is in the name of the LORD, <br/> 
          who made heaven and earth.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>   Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, <br/> 
          for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness. <br/><sup>2</sup>   Why should the nations say, <br/> 
          “Where is their God?”</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   Our God is in the heavens; <br/> 
          he does whatever he pleases. <br/><sup>4</sup>   Their idols are silver and gold, <br/> 
          the work of human hands. <br/><sup>5</sup>   They have mouths, but do not speak; <br/> 
          eyes, but do not see. <br/><sup>6</sup>   They have ears, but do not hear; <br/> 
          noses, but do not smell. <br/><sup>7</sup>   They have hands, but do not feel; <br/> 
          feet, but do not walk; <br/> 
          they make no sound in their throats. <br/><sup>8</sup>   Those who make them are like them; <br/> 
          so are all who trust in them.</p>
<br/><p><sup>9</sup>   O Israel, trust in the LORD! <br/> 
          He is their help and their shield. <br/><sup>10</sup>  O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! <br/> 
          He is their help and their shield. <br/><sup>11</sup>  You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! <br/> 
          He is their help and their shield.</p>
<br/><p><sup>12</sup>  The LORD has been mindful of us; he will bless us; <br/> 
          he will bless the house of Israel; <br/> 
          he will bless the house of Aaron; <br/><sup>13</sup>  he will bless those who fear the LORD, <br/> 
          both small and great.</p>
<br/><p><sup>14</sup>  May the LORD give you increase, <br/> 
          both you and your children. <br/><sup>15</sup>  May you be blessed by the LORD, <br/> 
          who made heaven and earth.</p>
<br/><p><sup>16</sup>  The heavens are the Lord’s heavens, <br/>  
          but the earth he has given to human beings. <br/><sup>17</sup>  The dead do not praise the LORD, <br/> 
          nor do any that go down into silence. <br/><sup>18</sup>  But we will bless the LORD <br/> 
          from this time on and forevermore. <br/> 
     Praise the LORD!</p>
