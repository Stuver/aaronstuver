<p class="kappa">Evening Psalm 9</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; <br/> 
          I will tell of all your wonderful deeds. <br/><sup>2</sup>   I will be glad and exult in you; <br/> 
          I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</p>
<br/><p><sup>3</sup>   When my enemies turned back, <br/> 
          they stumbled and perished before you. <br/><sup>4</sup>   For you have maintained my just cause; <br/> 
          you have sat on the throne giving righteous judgment.</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked; <br/> 
          you have blotted out their name forever and ever. <br/><sup>6</sup>   The enemies have vanished in everlasting ruins; <br/> 
          their cities you have rooted out; <br/> 
          the very memory of them has perished.</p>
<br/><p><sup>7</sup>   But the LORD sits enthroned forever, <br/> 
          he has established his throne for judgment. <br/><sup>8</sup>   He judges the world with righteousness; <br/> 
          he judges the peoples with equity.</p>
<br/><p><sup>9</sup>   The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, <br/> 
          a stronghold in times of trouble. <br/><sup>10</sup>  And those who know your name put their trust in you, <br/> 
          for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.</p>
<br/><p><sup>11  </sup>Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion. <br/> 
          Declare his deeds among the peoples. <br/><sup>12</sup>  For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; <br/> 
          he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<br/><p><sup>13</sup>  Be gracious to me, O LORD. <br/> 
          See what I suffer from those who hate me; <br/> 
          you are the one who lifts me up from the gates of death, <br/><sup>14</sup>  so that I may recount all your praises, <br/> 
          and, in the gates of daughter Zion, <br/> 
          rejoice in your deliverance.</p>
<br/><p><sup>15</sup>  The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; <br/> 
          in the net that they hid has their own foot been caught. <br/><sup>16</sup>  The LORD has made himself known, he has executed judgment; <br/> 
          the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. <em>Higgaion. Selah</em></p> <br/><p><sup>17</sup>  The wicked shall depart to Sheol, <br/> 
          all the nations that forget God.</p>
<br/><p><sup>18</sup>  For the needy shall not always be forgotten, <br/> 
          nor the hope of the poor perish forever.</p>
<br/><p><sup>19</sup>  Rise up, O LORD! Do not let mortals prevail; <br/> 
          let the nations be judged before you. <br/><sup>20</sup>  Put them in fear, O LORD; <br/> 
          let the nations know that they are only human. <em>Selah</em></p>

<p class="kappa">Evening Psalm 118</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; <br/> 
          his steadfast love endures forever!</p>
<br/><p><sup>2</sup>   Let Israel say, <br/> 
          “His steadfast love endures forever.” <br/><sup>3</sup>   Let the house of Aaron say, <br/> 
          “His steadfast love endures forever.” <br/><sup>4</sup>   Let those who fear the LORD say, <br/> 
          “His steadfast love endures forever.”</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Out of my distress I called on the LORD; <br/> 
          the LORD answered me and set me in a broad place. <br/><sup>6</sup>   With the LORD on my side I do not fear. <br/> 
          What can mortals do to me? <br/><sup>7</sup>   The LORD is on my side to help me; <br/> 
          I shall look in triumph on those who hate me. <br/><sup>8</sup>   It is better to take refuge in the LORD <br/> 
          than to put confidence in mortals. <br/><sup>9</sup>   It is better to take refuge in the LORD <br/> 
          than to put confidence in princes.</p>
<br/><p><sup>10</sup>  All nations surrounded me; <br/> 
          in the name of the LORD I cut them off! <br/><sup>11</sup>  They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side; <br/> 
          in the name of the LORD I cut them off! <br/><sup>12</sup>  They surrounded me like bees; <br/> 
          they blazed like a fire of thorns; <br/> 
          in the name of the LORD I cut them off! <br/><sup>13</sup>  I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, <br/> 
          but the LORD helped me. <br/><sup>14</sup>  The LORD is my strength and my might; <br/> 
          he has become my salvation.</p>
<br/><p><sup>15</sup>  There are glad songs of victory in the tents of the righteous: <br/> 
     “The right hand of the LORD does valiantly; <br/><sup>16</sup>       the right hand of the LORD is exalted; <br/> 
          the right hand of the LORD does valiantly.” <br/><sup>17</sup>  I shall not die, but I shall live, <br/> 
          and recount the deeds of the LORD. <br/><sup>18</sup>  The LORD has punished me severely, <br/> 
          but he did not give me over to death.</p>
<br/><p><sup>19</sup>  Open to me the gates of righteousness, <br/> 
          that I may enter through them <br/> 
          and give thanks to the LORD.</p>
<br/><p><sup>20</sup>  This is the gate of the LORD; <br/> 
          the righteous shall enter through it.</p>
<br/><p><sup>21</sup>  I thank you that you have answered me <br/> 
          and have become my salvation. <br/><sup>22</sup>  The stone that the builders rejected <br/> 
          has become the chief cornerstone. <br/><sup>23</sup>  This is the LORD’s doing; <br/> 
          it is marvelous in our eyes. <br/><sup>24</sup>  This is the day that the LORD has made; <br/> 
          let us rejoice and be glad in it. <br/><sup>25</sup>  Save us, we beseech you, O LORD! <br/> 
          O LORD, we beseech you, give us success!</p>
<br/><p><sup>26</sup>  Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the LORD. <br/> 
          We bless you from the house of the LORD. <br/><sup>27</sup>  The LORD is God, <br/> 
          and he has given us light. <br/> 
     Bind the festal procession with branches, <br/> 
          up to the horns of the altar.</p>
<br/><p><sup>28</sup>  You are my God, and I will give thanks to you; <br/> 
          you are my God, I will extol you.</p>
<br/><p><sup>29</sup>  O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, <br/> 
          for his steadfast love endures forever.</p>
