<p class="kappa">Evening Psalm 66</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth; <br/><sup>2</sup>        sing the glory of his name; <br/> 
          give to him glorious praise. <br/><sup>3</sup>   Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! <br/> 
          Because of your great power, your enemies cringe before you. <br/><sup>4</sup>   All the earth worships you; <br/> 
          they sing praises to you, <br/> 
          sing praises to your name. <em>Selah</em></p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Come and see what God has done: <br/> 
          he is awesome in his deeds among mortals. <br/><sup>6</sup>   He turned the sea into dry land; <br/> 
          they passed through the river on foot. <br/> 
     There we rejoiced in him, <br/><sup>7</sup>        who rules by his might forever, <br/> 
     whose eyes keep watch on the nations — <br/> 
          let the rebellious not exalt themselves. <em>Selah</em></p>
<br/><p><sup>8</sup>   Bless our God, O peoples, <br/> 
          let the sound of his praise be heard, <br/><sup>9</sup>   who has kept us among the living, <br/> 
          and has not let our feet slip. <br/><sup>10</sup>  For you, O God, have tested us; <br/> 
          you have tried us as silver is tried. <br/><sup>11</sup>  You brought us into the net; <br/> 
          you laid burdens on our backs; <br/><sup>12</sup>  you let people ride over our heads; <br/> 
          we went through fire and through water; <br/> 
     yet you have brought us out to a spacious place.</p>
<br/><p><sup>13</sup>  I will come into your house with burnt offerings; <br/> 
          I will pay you my vows, <br/><sup>14</sup>  those that my lips uttered <br/> 
          and my mouth promised when I was in trouble. <br/><sup>15</sup>  I will offer to you burnt offerings of fatlings, <br/> 
          with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; <br/> 
     I will make an offering of bulls and goats. <em>Selah</em></p>
<br/><p><sup>16</sup>  Come and hear, all you who fear God, <br/> 
          and I will tell what he has done for me. <br/><sup>17</sup>  I cried aloud to him, <br/> 
          and he was extolled with my tongue. <br/><sup>18</sup>  If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, <br/> 
          the Lord would not have listened. <br/><sup>19</sup>  But truly God has listened; <br/> 
          he has given heed to the words of my prayer.</p>
<br/><p><sup>20</sup>  Blessed be God, <br/> 
          because he has not rejected my prayer <br/> 
          or removed his steadfast love from me.</p>

<p class="kappa">Evening Psalm 116</p>
<div>
<p><sup>1</sup>   I love the LORD, because he has heard <br/> 
          my voice and my supplications. <br/><sup>2</sup>   Because he inclined his ear to me, <br/> 
          therefore I will call on him as long as I live. <br/><sup>3</sup>   The snares of death encompassed me; <br/> 
          the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; <br/> 
          I suffered distress and anguish. <br/><sup>4</sup>   Then I called on the name of the LORD: <br/> 
          “O LORD, I pray, save my life!”</p>
<br/><p><sup>5</sup>   Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; <br/> 
          our God is merciful. <br/><sup>6</sup>   The LORD protects the simple; <br/> 
          when I was brought low, he saved me. <br/><sup>7</sup>   Return, O my soul, to your rest, <br/> 
          for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.</p>
<br/><p><sup>8</sup>   For you have delivered my soul from death, <br/> 
          my eyes from tears, <br/> 
          my feet from stumbling. <br/><sup>9</sup>   I walk before the LORD <br/> 
          in the land of the living. <br/><sup>10</sup>  I kept my faith, even when I said, <br/> 
          “I am greatly afflicted”; <br/><sup>11</sup>  I said in my consternation, <br/> 
          “Everyone is a liar.”</p>
<br/><p><sup>12</sup>  What shall I return to the LORD <br/> 
          for all his bounty to me? <br/><sup>13</sup>   I will lift up the cup of salvation <br/> 
          and call on the name of the LORD, <br/><sup>14</sup>  I will pay my vows to the LORD <br/> 
          in the presence of all his people. <br/><sup>15</sup>  Precious in the sight of the LORD <br/> 
          is the death of his faithful ones. <br/><sup>16</sup>  O LORD, I am your servant; <br/> 
          I am your servant, the child of your serving girl. <br/> 
          You have loosed my bonds. <br/><sup>17</sup>  I will offer to you a thanksgiving sacrifice <br/> 
          and call on the name of the LORD. <br/><sup>18</sup>  I will pay my vows to the LORD <br/> 
          in the presence of all his people, <br/><sup>19</sup>  in the courts of the house of the LORD, <br/> 
          in your midst, O Jerusalem. <br/> 
     Praise the LORD!</p> </div>
