<div><p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>When the sabbath was
          over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and
          Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint
          him. <sup>2</sup>And very early on
          the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they
          went to the tomb. <sup>3</sup>They
          had been saying to one another, "Who will roll away
          the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
          <sup>4</sup>When they looked up,
          they saw that the stone, which was very large, had
          already been rolled back. <sup>5</sup>As they entered the tomb, they saw
          a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the
          right side; and they were alarmed. <sup>6</sup>But he said to them, "Do not
          be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who
          was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look,
          there is the place they laid him. <sup>7</sup>But go, tell his disciples and
          Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you
          will see him, just as he told you." <sup>8</sup>So they went out and fled from the
          tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they
          said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
