<p class="indent"><sup>18</sup>Some Sadducees, who
          say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a
          question, saying, <sup>19</sup>"Teacher, Moses wrote for us
          that 'if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but
          no child, the man shall marry the widow and raise up
          children for his brother.' <sup>20</sup>There were seven brothers; the
          first married and, when he died, left no children;
          <sup>21</sup>and the second
          married her and died, leaving no children; and the third
          likewise; <sup>22</sup>none of the
          seven left children. Last of all the woman herself died.
          <sup>23</sup>In the resurrection
          whose wife will she be? For the seven had married
          her."
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>24</sup>Jesus said to them,
          "Is not this the reason you are wrong, that you know
          neither the scriptures nor the power of God? <sup>25</sup>For when they rise from the dead,
          they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are
          like angels in heaven. <sup>26</sup>And as for the dead being raised,
          have you not read in the book of Moses, in the story
          about the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of
          Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
          <sup>27</sup>He is God not of the
          dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong."
