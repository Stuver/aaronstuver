<div><p class="indent"><sup>16</sup>Now the eleven
          disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus
          had directed them. <sup>17</sup>When they saw him, they worshiped
          him; but some doubted. <sup>18</sup>And Jesus came and said to them,
          "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given
          to me. <sup>19</sup>Go therefore
          and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
          name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
          <sup>20</sup>and teaching them to
          obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember,
          I am with you always, to the end of the age."
