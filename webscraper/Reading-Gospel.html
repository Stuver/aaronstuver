<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>After the sabbath, as
          the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and
          the other Mary went to see the tomb. <sup>2</sup>And suddenly there was a great
          earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from
          heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
          <sup>3</sup>His appearance was
          like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
          <sup>4</sup>For fear of him the
          guards shook and became like dead men. <sup>5</sup>But the angel said to the women,
          "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for
          Jesus who was crucified. <sup>6</sup>He is not here; for he has been
          raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
          <sup>7</sup>Then go quickly and
          tell his disciples, 'He has been raised from the
          dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee;
          there you will see him.' This is my message for
          you." <sup>8</sup>So they
          left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to
          tell his disciples. <sup>9</sup>Suddenly Jesus met them and said,
          "Greetings!" And they came to him, took hold of
          his feet, and worshiped him. <sup>10</sup>Then Jesus said to them, "Do
          not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee;
          there they will see me."
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>11</sup>While they were
          going, some of the guard went into the city and told the
          chief priests everything that had happened. <sup>12</sup>After the priests had assembled
          with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum
          of money to the soldiers, <sup>13</sup>telling them, "You must say,
          'His disciples came by night and stole him away while
          we were asleep.' <sup>14</sup>If this comes to the
          governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out
          of trouble." <sup>15</sup>So
          they took the money and did as they were directed. And
          this story is still told among the Jews to this day.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>16</sup>Now the eleven
          disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus
          had directed them.
