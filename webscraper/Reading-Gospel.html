<div><p class="indent"><sup>36</sup>Simon Peter said to
          him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus
          answered, "Where I am going, you cannot follow me
          now; but you will follow afterward." <sup>37</sup>Peter said to him, "Lord,
          why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for
          you." <sup>38</sup>Jesus
          answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Very
          truly, I tell you, before the cock crows, you will have
          denied me three times."
