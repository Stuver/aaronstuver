<div><p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>But on the first day
          of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, taking
          the spices that they had prepared. <sup>2</sup>They found the stone rolled away
          from the tomb, <sup>3</sup>but
          when they went in, they did not find the body.
          <sup>4</sup>While they were
          perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling
          clothes stood beside them. <sup>5</sup>The women were terrified and bowed
          their faces to the ground, but the men said to them,
          "Why do you look for the living among the dead? He
          is not here, but has risen. <sup>6</sup>Remember how he told you, while he
          was still in Galilee, <sup>7</sup>that the Son of Man must be handed
          over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day
          rise again." <sup>8</sup>Then
          they remembered his words, <sup>9</sup>and returning from the tomb, they
          told all this to the eleven and to all the rest.
          <sup>10</sup>Now it was Mary
          Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the
          other women with them who told this to the apostles.
          <sup>11</sup>But these words
          seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe
          them. <sup>12</sup>But Peter got
          up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw
          the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed
          at what had happened.
