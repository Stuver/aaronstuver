<p class="indent"><sup>18</sup>"I will not
          leave you orphaned; I am coming to you. <sup>19</sup>In a little while the world will
          no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live,
          you also will live. <sup>20</sup>On that day you will know that I
          am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
          <sup>21</sup>They who have my
          commandments and keep them are those who love me; and
          those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will
          love them and reveal myself to them." <sup>22</sup>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him,
          "Lord, how is it that you will reveal yourself to
          us, and not to the world?" <sup>23</sup>Jesus answered him, "Those
          who love me will keep my word, and my Father will love
          them, and we will come to them and make our home with
          them. <sup>24</sup>Whoever does
          not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you
          hear is not mine, but is from the Father who sent me.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>25</sup>"I have said
          these things to you while I am still with you.
          <sup>26</sup>But the Advocate, the
          Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will
          teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have
          said to you. <sup>27</sup>Peace I
          leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to
          you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be
          troubled, and do not let them be afraid. <sup>28</sup>You heard me say to you, 'I
          am going away, and I am coming to you.' If you loved
          me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father,
          because the Father is greater than I. <sup>29</sup>And now I have told you this
          before it occurs, so that when it does occur, you may
          believe. <sup>30</sup>I will no
          longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is
          coming. He has no power over me; <sup>31</sup>but I do as the Father has
          commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the
          Father. Rise, let us be on our way."
