<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>13</sup>Therefore prepare
          your minds for action; discipline yourselves; set all
          your hope on the grace that Jesus Christ will bring you
          when he is revealed. <sup>14</sup>Like obedient children, do not be
          conformed to the desires that you formerly had in
          ignorance. <sup>15</sup>Instead,
          as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all
          your conduct; <sup>16</sup>for it
          is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>17</sup>If you invoke as
          Father the one who judges all people impartially
          according to their deeds, live in reverent fear during
          the time of your exile. <sup>18</sup>You know that you were ransomed
          from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors, not
          with perishable things like silver or gold, <sup>19</sup>but with the precious blood of
          Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish.
          <sup>20</sup>He was destined
          before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at
          the end of the ages for your sake. <sup>21</sup>Through him you have come to
          trust in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him
          glory, so that your faith and hope are set on God.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>22</sup>Now that you have
          purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so
          that you have genuine mutual love, love one another
          deeply from the heart. <sup>23</sup>You have been born anew, not of
          perishable but of imperishable seed, through the living
          and enduring word of God. <sup>24</sup>For "All flesh is like grass
          and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass
          withers, and the flower falls, <sup>25</sup>but the word of the Lord endures
          forever." That word is the good news that was
          announced to you.
