<p class="kappa">Second Reading 1 Peter 1:10-20</p>
<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>10</sup>Concerning this
          salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that
          was to be yours made careful search and inquiry,
          <sup>11</sup>inquiring about the
          person or time that the Spirit of Christ within them
          indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings
          destined for Christ and the subsequent glory.
          <sup>12</sup>It was revealed to
          them that they were serving not themselves but you, in
          regard to the things that have now been announced to you
          through those who brought you good news by the Holy
          Spirit sent from heaven - things into which angels long
          to look!
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>13</sup>Therefore prepare
          your minds for action; discipline yourselves; set all
          your hope on the grace that Jesus Christ will bring you
          when he is revealed. <sup>14</sup>Like obedient children, do not be
          conformed to the desires that you formerly had in
          ignorance. <sup>15</sup>Instead,
          as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all
          your conduct; <sup>16</sup>for it
          is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>17</sup>If you invoke as
          Father the one who judges all people impartially
          according to their deeds, live in reverent fear during
          the time of your exile. <sup>18</sup>You know that you were ransomed
          from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors, not
          with perishable things like silver or gold, <sup>19</sup>but with the precious blood of
          Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish.
          <sup>20</sup>He was destined
          before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at
          the end of the ages for your sake.
        </p>
