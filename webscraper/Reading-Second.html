<p class="kappa">Second Reading 1 Corinthians 15:1-11</p>
<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>Now I would remind
          you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I
          proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which
          also you stand, <sup>2</sup>through which also you are being
          saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I
          proclaimed to you - unless you have come to believe in
          vain.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>3</sup>For I handed on to you
          as of first importance what I in turn had received: that
          Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
          scriptures, <sup>4</sup>and that
          he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in
          accordance with the scriptures, <sup>5</sup>and that he appeared to Cephas,
          then to the twelve. <sup>6</sup>Then he appeared to more than five
          hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom
          are still alive, though some have died. <sup>7</sup>Then he appeared to James, then to
          all the apostles. <sup>8</sup>Last
          of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.
          <sup>9</sup>For I am the least of
          the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I
          persecuted the church of God. <sup>10</sup>But by the grace of God I am what
          I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On
          the contrary, I worked harder than any of them - though
          it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
          <sup>11</sup>Whether then it was I
          or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.
