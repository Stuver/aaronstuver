<p class="kappa">Second Reading John 1:1-18</p>
<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>In the beginning was
          the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
          God. <sup>2</sup>He was in the
          beginning with God. <sup>3</sup>All things came into being through
          him, and without him not one thing came into being. What
          has come into being <sup>4</sup>in
          him was life, and the life was the light of all people.
          <sup>5</sup>The light shines in
          the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>6</sup>There was a man sent
          from God, whose name was John. <sup>7</sup>He came as a witness to testify to
          the light, so that all might believe through him.
          <sup>8</sup>He himself was not the
          light, but he came to testify to the light. <sup>9</sup>The true light, which enlightens
          everyone, was coming into the world.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>10</sup>He was in the world,
          and the world came into being through him; yet the world
          did not know him. <sup>11</sup>He
          came to what was his own, and his own people did not
          accept him. <sup>12</sup>But to
          all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave
          power to become children of God, <sup>13</sup>who were born, not of blood or of
          the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>14</sup>And the Word became
          flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the
          glory as of a father's only son, full of grace and
          truth. <sup>15</sup>(John
          testified to him and cried out, "This was he of whom
          I said, 'He who comes after me ranks ahead of me
          because he was before me.'") <sup>16</sup>From his fullness we have all
          received, grace upon grace. <sup>17</sup>The law indeed was given through
          Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
          <sup>18</sup>No one has ever seen
          God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the
          Father's heart, who has made him known.
