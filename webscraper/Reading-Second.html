<p class="indent"><sup>16</sup>So we do not lose
          heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away, our
          inner nature is being renewed day by day. <sup>17</sup>For this slight momentary
          affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory
          beyond all measure, <sup>18</sup>because we look not at what can
          be seen but at what cannot be seen; for what can be seen
          is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>1</sup>For we know that if
          the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a
          building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal
          in the heavens. <sup>2</sup>For in
          this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our
          heavenly dwelling - <sup>3</sup>if
          indeed, when we have taken it off we will not be found
          naked. <sup>4</sup>For while we
          are still in this tent, we groan under our burden,
          because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further
          clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by
          life. <sup>5</sup>He who has
          prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us
          the Spirit as a guarantee.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>6</sup>So we are always
          confident; even though we know that while we are at home
          in the body we are away from the Lord - <sup>7</sup>for we walk by faith, not by
          sight. <sup>8</sup>Yes, we do have
          confidence, and we would rather be away from the body and
          at home with the Lord. <sup>9</sup>So whether we are at home or away,
          we make it our aim to please him. <sup>10</sup>For all of us must appear before
          the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive
          recompense for what has been done in the body, whether
          good or evil.
