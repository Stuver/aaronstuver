<p class="indent"><sup>51</sup>Listen, I will tell
          you a mystery! We will not all die, but we will all be
          changed, <sup>52</sup>in a moment,
          in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the
          trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised
          imperishable, and we will be changed. <sup>53</sup>For this perishable body must put
          on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on
          immortality. <sup>54</sup>When
          this perishable body puts on imperishability, and this
          mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is
          written will be fulfilled: "Death has been swallowed
          up in victory." <sup>55</sup>"Where, O death, is your
          victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"
          <sup>56</sup>The sting of death is
          sin, and the power of sin is the law. <sup>57</sup>But thanks be to God, who gives
          us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>58</sup>Therefore, my
          beloved, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the
          work of the Lord, because you know that in the Lord your
          labor is not in vain.
