<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>29</sup>Otherwise, what will
          those people do who receive baptism on behalf of the
          dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people
          baptized on their behalf?
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>30</sup>And why are we
          putting ourselves in danger every hour? <sup>31</sup>I die every day! That is as
          certain, brothers and sisters, as my boasting of you - a
          boast that I make in Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup>32</sup>If with merely human hopes I
          fought with wild animals at Ephesus, what would I have
          gained by it? If the dead are not raised, "Let us
          eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." <sup>33</sup>Do not be deceived: "Bad
          company ruins good morals." <sup>34</sup>Come to a sober and right mind,
          and sin no more; for some people have no knowledge of
          God. I say this to your shame.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>35</sup>But someone will ask,
          "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do
          they come?" <sup>36</sup>Fool! What you sow does not come
          to life unless it dies. <sup>37</sup>And as for what you sow, you do
          not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps
          of wheat or of some other grain. <sup>38</sup>But God gives it a body as he has
          chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.
          <sup>39</sup>Not all flesh is
          alike, but there is one flesh for human beings, another
          for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
          <sup>40</sup>There are both
          heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the
          heavenly is one thing, and that of the earthly is
          another. <sup>41</sup>There is one
          glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
          another glory of the stars; indeed, star differs from
          star in glory.
