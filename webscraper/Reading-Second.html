<div>
<p class="indent"><sup>41</sup>There is one glory of
          the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory
          of the stars; indeed, star differs from star in glory.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>42</sup>So it is with the
          resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable,
          what is raised is imperishable. <sup>43</sup>It is sown in dishonor, it is
          raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in
          power. <sup>44</sup>It is sown a
          physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is
          a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.
          <sup>45</sup>Thus it is written,
          "The first man, Adam, became a living being";
          the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. <sup>46</sup>But it is not the spiritual that
          is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual.
          <sup>47</sup>The first man was
          from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from
          heaven. <sup>48</sup>As was the
          man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is
          the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven.
          <sup>49</sup>Just as we have borne
          the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image
          of the man of heaven.
        </p>
<p class="indent"><sup>50</sup>What I am saying,
          brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot
          inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable
          inherit the imperishable.
